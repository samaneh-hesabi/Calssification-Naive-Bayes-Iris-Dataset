# 1. Project Overview
This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier for the Iris dataset, demonstrating a complete machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation. The implementation follows best practices in machine learning and Python development.

# 1.1 Dataset Description
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species:
- Iris setosa
- Iris versicolor
- Iris virginica

Each sample has four features:
1. Sepal length (cm)
2. Sepal width (cm)
3. Petal length (cm)
4. Petal width (cm)

The dataset is balanced, with 50 samples from each species.

# 1.2 Methodology
## 1.2.1 Data Preprocessing
- Standardization of features using z-score normalization
- Train-test split (80% training, 20% testing)
- Handling of missing values (if any)
- Feature selection and analysis

## 1.2.2 Model Implementation
The project implements Gaussian Naive Bayes, which assumes:
- Features are conditionally independent given the class
- Each feature follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution
- Prior probabilities are estimated from the training data

## 1.2.3 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report
